        <h4>Browser Support</h4>
        <h5>
            This site works best on <b>Mozilla Firfox.</b> Although it works well on chrome, there is a small issue
            with the youtube video, which might look like a bug to you, but that is how it works on www.youtube.com as well.
            You can test it on chrome as follows:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Go on www.youtube.com</li>
            <li>Search for "The Lion King"</li>
            <li>Click "30 minutes movies: The Lion King"</li>
            <li>Now search for any other thing, you will notice that the video is still playing in the background.</li>
        </ol>

        in the documentation.</h5>
