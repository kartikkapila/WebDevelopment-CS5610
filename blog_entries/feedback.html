<p>In this week, I developed a feedback page. I completed this in three stages. In the first stage, I handled events using jQuery.</p>
<p>So when the user presses "return", a alert box is shown saying that "Thanks for your feedback"</p>

<p> In the next experiment, I captured the feedback entered by the user and showed that in the alert box</p>

<p>In the next experiment, The feedback entered by the user is shown on the page. You can check my experiments on jQuery by clicking <a href="../experiments/Experiments.aspx">here</a></p>
<p>In the next week, Ill try to save the comments of the user in the database and display all the feedbacks on the page</p>
