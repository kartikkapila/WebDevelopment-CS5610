<p>In this week, I tried few experiments on databases. This will be used in my project to store user information.</p>
<p>There will be two types of login, one for the admins and one for the users. The admins will be able to look at the user content
and remove content which is not appropriate.</p>
<p>You can look at the experiments <a href="../experiments/Experiments.aspx">here</a></p>
