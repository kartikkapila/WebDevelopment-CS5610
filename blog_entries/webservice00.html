<p>In this week, I tried a few simple experiments based on WebServices</p>
<p>I used the api provided by rotten tomatoes, to query about movies and displayed the title and thumbnail of the movies on my page.</p>
<p>You can check out the experiments over <a href="../experiments/Experiments.aspx">here</a></p>
<p>In the coming week, I will be adding more experiments on web services like handling click events when the thumbnail is clicked etc</p>
