<p>In this week, I tried the login experiments, created roles such as member and admin for specific users.</p>
<p>You can check out the login experiments by clicking <a href="../experiments/Experiments.aspx">here</a></p>
<p>Also, I worked with the youtube player api, so now, when the users searches for a movie, they can also see the trailer of the 
movie</p>
<p>Here is the screenshot for the same</p>
