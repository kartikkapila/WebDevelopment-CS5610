<p>In this week, I concentrated on developing the homepage without using bootstrap. </p>
<p>For organizing my homepage, in a css made table layout, I had to practice the display:table, display:row, display:cell property of the display field</p>
<p>My experiments on the display field property can be found <a href="../experiments/exp05/CSS-Table-Display.aspx">here</a></p>
<p>Also, I practiced designing the buttons, which I will use later on in my projext.</p>
