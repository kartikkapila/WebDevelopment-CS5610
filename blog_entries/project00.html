<p>This week, I concentrated on creating the layout of my project. I made two major areas 1. Home and 2. Profile.
Its a single page application, so at a time only one of these areas is visible.</p>
<p>If the user searches for a movie, the third area i.e search results area is displayed.</p>
<p>I created a generic modal window, which can be used when the user presses login, or when the user clicks on a movie</p>
<p>Upcoming movies are displayed along with play controls by which the user can check out the upcoming movies.</p>

<p>You can check out my work over <a href="../project/Default.aspx">here</a></p>
